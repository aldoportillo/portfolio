        I'm deeply invested in scaling my skills both horizontally across new
        technologies and vertically by diving deeper into current projects. My
        portfolio showcases the projects I'm actively working on, each
        reflecting my dedication to not just broadening my tech horizon, but
        also deepening my expertise in every aspect of development.

            A personal project combining my love for bartending and chemistry.

          <h3>Body Track Pro</h3>
          <p>
            Fusing my interests in fitness and nutrition, I created this app to
            monitor health metrics and offer personalized nutrition plans. It's
            set to integrate with MFP and health devices for a seamless fitness
            tracking experience.

          <p>
            Born from my passion for wine, this app is designed to visually
            explore and understand wine regions and vineyards. Using a spatial
            database, it will bring the intricate details of wine making to
            enthusiasts' fingertips.
