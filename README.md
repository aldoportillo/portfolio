# Personal Portfolio

## I'm building this portfolio using the MERN stack

### Updates

- December 5, 2022: I decided to publish my client side application. I know if I try to make it perfect, I will never publish it, so I am forcing myself to publish something at the moment even though I am not satisfied.

### Next Step

- Create functionality for the contact page using Express
- Use MongoDB to host blog posts and use express to call database
- Add functionality to add videos and gifs to blogs
- Add CSS transitions
